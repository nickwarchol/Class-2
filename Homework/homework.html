            <strong>Hi, my name is Nick Warchol and this is my first semester at San Diego Global Knowledge University. I have a bit of experience in self-taught coding that I would study from Youtube, or Codecademy. Below are a few things about me and what I like to do.</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>One of my favorite sports is ice hockey. When I was in highschool I played for the team for<br/> about two years. After school I found an adult league I participated in.</li>
                <br>
                <li> I was raised a military child and doing so I got to live overseas and experience<br/> lots of different cultures. Everyone in my family is military and I am blessed<br/> to be living in such an amazing country. </li>
                <br>
                <li>A hobby of mine is also studying about cars, driving them, drifting them,<br/> and taking pictures with them. I love my car and it helps me get out of the<br/> house and want to go and travel all the beauties in San Diego.</li> 
    
            </ul>

     <p> The picture on the left is a picture of when I went to Los Angeles a couple weeks ago and you can get a good idea of what I look like.

     <p>  The picture on the bottom right took place on december third, the day after my twenty-first</br> birthday. I was able to take my car to a place called Apple Valley Speedway and spend the day there. Its a racetrack but I chose to drift it which is one of my passions.
